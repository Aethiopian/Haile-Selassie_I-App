                                    Early Life: He was born on July 23, 1892, in the Ethiopian town of Ejersa Goro. He belonged to the Solomonic dynasty, which claimed descent from the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.

Rise to Power: Haile Selassie became regent of Ethiopia in 1916 and then emperor (or "Negus") in 1930 following the death of Empress Zewditu. He took the throne name Haile Selassie, which means "Might of the Trinity" in Amharic.

Modernization Efforts: During his reign, Haile Selassie implemented a series of modernization reforms in Ethiopia. These included the construction of infrastructure such as roads, schools, and hospitals, as well as efforts to modernize the military and the legal system.

Italian Invasion: In 1935, Ethiopia was invaded by fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini. Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations for assistance but received little support. He went into exile in Britain but continued to advocate for Ethiopia's independence.

Return to Power: Haile Selassie returned to Ethiopia in 1941 after the country was liberated from Italian occupation by Allied forces during World War II. He resumed his role as emperor and worked to rebuild the country.

End of Reign: In 1974, Haile Selassie was overthrown in a coup led by the Derg, a Marxist-Leninist military junta. He was placed under house arrest and later died under mysterious circumstances in 1975, leading to speculation about the circumstances of his death.

Legacy: Haile Selassie remains a significant figure in Ethiopian history and is revered by Rastafarians, who believe he is the messiah or divine figure mentioned in their religious beliefs. He is also remembered for his efforts to promote African unity and independence on the international stage.

                                    "God and history will remember your judgment. For the present, it is you who are the judges; therefore, be just. But soon, I shall stand before the judgment seat of God, who has purchased me and my people."

In this powerful speech, Haile Selassie passionately appealed to the League of Nations for assistance in defending Ethiopia's sovereignty and independence against the aggression of fascist Italy. Despite his impassioned plea, the League of Nations failed to take effective action, and Ethiopia faced occupation and hardship.

This speech reflects Haile Selassie's determination to fight for his country's freedom and his belief in justice and righteousness. It has become emblematic of Ethiopia's struggle against foreign aggression and continues to resonate with people around the world.
